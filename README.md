# Twilio Scripts and Proxy NUmber üì±‚ÜîÔ∏èüëª‚ÜîÔ∏èüì±
A couple of python scripts to interact with Twilio. This was devised so that I dont have to get business calls clogging my personal phone. The text_proxy_server.py script will run a server that will receive text on a twilio phone number. Inbound text will be routed to a personal phone number and your reply back will be routed to look as if came from the twilio number. <br><br>

Use Cases:
* Temporary or International numbers 
* A burner phone number for drug transactions and darkweb at only $1 a month
* A seperate number from your personal phone number (my case)


<b>Example Convo</b>, note that you will need to use actual phone numbers in E.164 format such as +13231234567. Also when going from Personal # -> Twilio# your text back should start with the number of the person you want to text/customer:
<br>üì±‚ÜîÔ∏èüëª‚ÜîÔ∏èüì±<br>
<b>Customer# -> Twilio#</b>: Hello I am looking for a quote on a new kitchen <br>
<b>Twilio# -> Personal</b>#: Customer#:"Hello I am looking for a quote on a new" <br>
<b>Personal# -> Twilio#</b>: Customer# Yes I can go ahead and schedule an estimate this week. <br><br>

You will need to have a twilio account, a phone number purchased, python, ngrok(a reverse proxy that creates a secure tunell from a public endpoint), and some elbow grease. See deployment section to see how to purchase a Twilio number and get going. <br><br>

## Structure
* config_sample.py : <b><i>rename file as config.py and replace the credentials with your information </b></i> to use, all the other scripts rely on the credentials from this
* test_sms.py : Testing out sending a text messages through twilio to myself, the first step in getting this going
* text_proxy_server.py : a server that will forward text back and forth between customers and my personal number so I dont have to give out my personal number. 
* update_ip.py : a script to update the ip address of the server in case it changes
* sms_conversation.py : A script to create conversations between two numbers, requires a server with twilio-cli installed source [Twilio Docs](https://www.twilio.com/docs/conversations/quickstart)

## Getting Started

Sign up for a twilio account, [use my affiliate link to sign up and get $10](www.twilio.com/referral/T0noIv). Photo below shows how to [purchase a phone number](https://www.twilio.com/console/phone-numbers/search) in twilio
![](./pics/buy-number.gif)

Replace the items in config_sample.py with your information, the private number will be your personal phone number/cell phone <b> make sure to rename the file to config.py</b>. 
```
twilio_sid = 'XXXXXXXXXXXXX'
twilio_token = 'XXXXXXXXXXXX'
TWILIO_NUMBER = "+13236211111"
PRIVATE_NUMBER = "+13231113118"
```


### Deploy 
Create virtual environment, install dependencies, and Ngrok. Ngrok will expose localhost port 5000 to incoming requests, it will provide us with a html that we can use in Twilio. 
```
virtualenv venv
pip install -r requirements.txt
sudo snap install ngrok #install ngrok on linux, if not in linux google how to install ngrok
ngrok http 5000 #start ngrok to expose port 5000
```

Below is a photo of how your phone numbers webhook should look like for texting. [Click your number to check the webhooks](https://www.twilio.com/console/phone-numbers/incoming)

Now you can run the text_proxy_server.py

* [] Email Support about Conversations
```
Rather than keeping the WhatsApp room separate from the chat or SMS rooms, Conversations brings it together, automatically proxying conversations between participants. Whether it‚Äôs a customer care scenario where agents and employees field inquiries over webchat, while consumers respond over SMS or WhatsApp, in-app chat, or a large online conversation paired with a video event (perhaps built within minutes with our Open Source ReactJS app), every participant can choose their preferred channel.
